* Name both files in this format `project_4_$GTACCOUNT`, e.g. project_4_gburdell3
* Compress only the directory **gtstore**
  * Do not include any object or library files.
  * Verify the `Makefile` inside working **correctly** on VM cluster to compile/run your program.
  * Do not pack the binary or metadata files, make sure to clean them (`$ make clean`) before archive your code.
  * Get necessary files or documents ready before you pack it. Like a more clear `README` for running your code.
  * Reference command for packing your code: `$ tar -czvf project_4_$GTACCOUNT.tar.gz ./gtstore`
* You may share ideas with other pairs, but you may not share code.
* You also may not download code or use any other external libraries without consulting the instructor or TA first.
